### Description
In [JSON schema language]( http://json-schema.org/) the data entities making up the conceptual model (Group, Farmer, Farm, Plot, Plotobservation) as described in the conceptual model are stored as [arrays of JSON objects](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/).

Each time a data entity is recorded a new JSON object is created and added to the array. The recording of the same data entity at another point in time needs to be added as a new record to allow for continuous monitoring and to allow the composition of farms and ownership to change overtime. The recording of the data entities therefore are timestamped. 

In the reference framework a system of 3 identifiers is proposed to uniquely identify objects and model the relationships between these objects. These Identifiers are called: 1 the InternalID, 2 the GeoID and 3 the GlobalRecordID. The system allows the exchange and merging of data that is structured in a similar way.

* **The InternalID** provides a means internally structure the data set uniquely identifying the objects in the dataset and relations between them.
* **The GeoID** provides an imperfect means to uniquely identify the object in the field and to clean the dataset when it is combined with datasets from other sources.
* **The GlobalRecordID** is a globally unique identifier for First Mile Farm data record.

**The GeoID** and **the GlobalRecordID** can be used to maintain the InternalID structure while exchanging data between organisations. This mechanism will be explained in more detail in the section on '*the identification Uniquely Identifying Objects*'. 

It is not required use all data entities (Farmer grouo, Farmer, Farm, Plot, Plot Observation) in a data bases while using the data structure. For example some organisations only want to collect plot level data, so no details are needed/available on which farmer manages the plot or to who the plot belongs. The arrays for group, farmer, and farm can be left empty. 

However to maintain compatibility of different global data sources it is essential that all data attributes are recorded at the right data entity level to maintain the internal structure of the data format. For example it does not fit the logic of the reference framework to add an attribute ‘farm size’ to the data entity ‘farmer’, even if that farmer owns or manages that farm. The farm and it’s size are inextricable, even if this is the only attribute recorded about farms in the data set. As a result the farm size of a farmer's farm can only be found by first finding the farm instance of the farmer's farm using internals keys and next the size of that farm instance.  

### Extensions
The reference framework is designed in such away that new data attributes or even new data entities for different purposes can be added to the model easily. This is illustrated under the heading extensions, for Cocoa action program and MARS Adoption Observations. The data formats are available together with the official protocols on how to collect the data in the field. 

By adding more and more extensions to the reference framework, a repositry emerges of 'proven' data formats and data collection protocols. Organsations can benefit from this repositry harvesting the formats and data collection protocols they need for their own data management. Having different data formats and datacollection methodologies in 1 repositry will also facilitate further standardization and interoperability discussions. To add to the reference framework please contact andre.jellema@data-impact.com.

In the following sections the core data entities of the generic data structure for farm data collection, storag and exchange will be further elaborated.

### Flattened table in Excel format
A flattened table in excel format is avialable [here](http://farm-level-data-standard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/first-mile-farm-data-schema-flattened.xlsx) The flattened table can be used to make a mapping from an existing data structure to the generic data structure for farm data collection, storag and exchange.

## Farmer group

**Definition**
Loosely defined group of farmers. Farmers can be member of a cooperative or union, organized by a company as contract farmers or as part of a support program, etc. 

**Data attributes**
Many attributes can be assigned to a group, also depending on the nature of the group. Some examples of common attributes are provided, like the area of operation, the valid certifications from standard organisations, total amount of certified produce in stock. Details will not further specified in depth in this version of the reference framework for first mile farm data collection, storage and exchange. The entity here is presented to demonstrate a coherent framework which is ready to be expanded or can customized depending on the requirements.

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

**Datastructure**
The data structure is visualised in the table below. All required data attributes are indicated in bold.

## The farmer

**Definition**
The farmer is the person that manages one or more farms, possibly helped by farm workers. The farmer takes the major management decisions even when the decision is to do contract farming where the farm practice is often prescribed in detail by an external actor. In this model the farmer is not necessarily the owner of the farm. A farmer can manage someone else’s farm. Nor does he or she need to be the owner of the assets composing the farm, e.g a sharecropper is seen as a farmer in this model. For a more detailed explanation on how ownership plays a role in modelling different farm types, see also the conceptual model in '*the approac*' section.

**Data attributes**

groupInternalIDs is an array of database specific identification linking a farmer to 0, 1 or more groups.

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

The farm
=========
**Definition**
A farm is described as a collection assets managed as 1 entity with the primarily objective to raise living organisms for food or raw materials. A farm often consists of fields, buildings and livestock and is run a farm manager and the farm owner has the rights on the produce. The farm owner and the farm owner are often united in 1 person: the farmer. A farm manager is often supported by farm workers to carry out the activities.

**Data attributes**

In the data model the farm modelled as a placeholder for foreign keys uniting all relevant data entities based on their keys together as 1 farm, including the farmer, the farm owner, the plots of the farm, the herds and the workers etc. 

Additional data entities describing the farm as a whole can be added to this data entity, like the farm boundary, farm area, or aggregated numbers like total amount of produce. Plot specific attributes should be added to the plot like the produce from a specific plot or a plot boundary.

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

## The plot

**Definition**
A plot is an area of land, enclosed or otherwise, used for agricultural purposes such as cultivating crops or for livestock.

**Data attributes**
The data entity plot describes the main and general characteristics of a plot: including location and geometry, but also agronomically. Examples are this plots: 
- seed variety (name/vendor/date/quantity in kg/ha)
- yields (kg/ha)
- pesticide use (product/trade name/vendor/date/ quantity in kg/ha)
- fertilizer use (product/trade name/vendor/date/quantity in kg/ha) and application method
- measured or calculated water use  (date/quantity in kg of harvested paddy/litre water input)
- timing of the different farm activities

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

The model can be expanded by creating rotation specific, crop specific data entities or data entities describing the agronomic conditions like soil type.

## The observation

**Definition**
Data obtained from an assessment in a plot, generally done at a specific location, in a transect or in an area. This data entity is not meant to describe the plot as a whole. Based on observations estimates are made for the characteristics of the plot as a whole. The observations are records of the ‘plot observation’ data entity, where as the estimation for the plot as a whole based on the observations should be added as a data attribute of the plot data entity. For example in a grass plot the biomass is measured at 3 points. This can be added to the data set as 3 plot observation records, the average biomass calculated for the plot can be added to the plot data entity.

**Data attributes**
Typical observations in a plot are: 
- three height, 
- number of branches, 
- good capture light and aeration, 
- height of Jorquette, 
- percentage of trees show old wilted, 
- number of dead or mummified pods, 
- number of dead branches, 
- number of damaged or diseased pods, 
- number of epiphytes 
- number of ant nests/tunnels nests,
- etc. 

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.
