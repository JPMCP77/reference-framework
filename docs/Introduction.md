More and more stakeholders in the smallholder value chain are collecting farm data as part of the data revolution in Agriculture. This data is used to
Establish relationships with farmers and support them in increasing productivity and quality of their crops
Ensure farmers are growing their crops sustainably and complying with sustainability standards
Monitor and measure the effectiveness and impact of farm initiatives by supply chain stakeholders

However, there are many different approaches how information about farms is being collected and stored, leading to the existence of multiple databases that contain similar data but are yet incompatible with each other. Not aligning on the way we collect farm data at this point would be a big missed opportunity. The volume of digital farm information will grow exponentially over the next 5-10 years but usability of these data may be unable to get its full potential if the community end up in many incompatible data sets.

Objectives
==================
The purpose of the reference framework for first mile farm data is to align the way that data about farmers, farms and farm practices is collected and stored by different organisations to facilitate the data exchange and interoperability of first mile farm data sets. In this document a first step towards such a reference framework is taken. It provides:
A conceptual model of a farm that can be used to map first mile farm data elements in a structured way. It function as a data exchange format or as a data model for field data collection and storage. The model is generic can be further customized and expanded for specific domains or organisations.
A approach to uniquely identify first mile farm data globally using 3 IDâ€™s are used This approach is basednon , to structure the data in the database and to maintain this structure when data from different origin are combined..
Best practice recommendations on spatial data collection.

The data model in this document is not describing all possible farm data elements and the best way to collect these in the field exhaustively. Currently many discussions on the standardization of monitoring and evaluation, e.g. what data needs to be collected to monitor progress and how, take place in sector specific round tables like cocoa action or the sustainable rice program. There is no use of duplicating these discussions here. The data model presented here is flexible and it will be demonstrated how the results of these discussions can be incorporated by mapping the data elements on the current structure and expending the structure where needed.
