the farmer
=========

A farmer is the person that manages one or more farms, possibly helped by farm workers. The farmer takes the major management decisions even when the decision is to do contract farming where the farm practice is often prescribed in detail by an external actor. In this model the farmer is not necessarily the owner of the farm. A farmer can manage someone elseâ€™s farm. Nor does he or she need to be the owner of the assets composing the farm, e.g a sharecropper is seen as a farmer in this model. For a more detailed explanation on how ownership plays a role in modelling different farm types, see the conceptual model section 3.1.
Data attributes:
As explained in section 4.1.1 the block [FarmerRecordGlobalID, FarmerInternalID, FarmerGeoID] provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmers, 2 to to provide each farmer with a unique internal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this individual and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

groupInternalIDs is an array of database specific identification linking a farmer to 0, 1 or more groups.

Required data attributes are indicated by grey shaded fields in the table below.
