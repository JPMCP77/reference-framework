Farmer group
===========
**Definition**
Loosely defined group of farmers. Farmers can be member of a cooperative or union, organized by a company as contract farmers or as part of a support program, etc. 

**Data attributes**
Many attributes can be assigned to a group, also depending on the nature of the group. Some examples of common attributes are provided, like the area of operation, the valid certifications from standard organisations, total amount of certified produce in stock. Details will not further specified in depth in this version of the reference framework for first mile farm data collection, storage and exchange. The entity here is presented to demonstrate a coherent framework which is ready to be expanded or can customized depending on the requirements.

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.

The data structure is visualised in the table below. All required data attributes are indicated in bold.
