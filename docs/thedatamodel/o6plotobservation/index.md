The plot observation
=========
**Definition**
Data obtained from an assessment in a plot, generally done at a specific location, in a transect or in an area. This data entity is not meant to describe the plot as a whole. Based on observations estimates are made for the characteristics of the plot as a whole. The observations are records of the ‘plot observation’ data entity, where as the estimation for the plot as a whole based on the observations should be added as a data attribute of the plot data entity. For example in a grass plot the biomass is measured at 3 points. This can be added to the data set as 3 plot observation records, the average biomass calculated for the plot can be added to the plot data entity.

**Data attributes**
Typical observations in a plot are: 
- three height, 
- number of branches, 
- good capture light and aeration, 
- height of Jorquette, 
- x% trees show old wilted, 
- # dead or mummified pods, 
- # dead branches, 
- # damaged or diseased pods, 
- # epiphytes 
- # ant nests/tunnels nests,
-  etc. 

As explained in section '*Uniquely identifying data elements*' {GroupRecordGlobalID, GroupInternalID, GroupGeoID} provides the means to: 1 globally uniquely identify all the records of farmer groups, 2 to to provide each farmer group with a unique interal ID which allows to link to link other data entities to this farmer group and; 3 to have a clue to uniquely identify this farmer group in the field or to clean the dataset when combined with datasets from other sources.
