About the reference framework
==================
This is the development version for the reference framework for first mile farm data. This resource aims to evolve into a set of shared guidelines on how to  collect, store and exchange data about farmers, farmer organisations, farms, plots and other data related to agricultural practice.   

The term ‘the first mile’ refers to the position of farmers at the start of the agricultural value chain. When moving up the chain, following all steps towards consumption, the distance to these food production area’s literally increases. While transparency and traceability in the value chain is of growing importance, data collection about ‘the first mile’ is generally difficult due to logistical reasons. There are many food producers and they are generally located in more remote areas making data collection labour intensive and expensive, especially in the case of small holder farming.

The purpose of the reference framework for first mile farm data is to align the way that data about farmers, farms and farm practices is collected and stored by different organisations to facilitate the data exchange and interoperability of first mile farm data sets. 

It provides:
1. **A generic data model for first mile farm data.** By modelling relations between the core data entities such as fields, farms, farmers and farmer organisations a generic data model for first mile farm data collecion has been developed. This data model can be used as a template for organisations to structure first-mile farm data collected in the field. The model can also function as a neutral data model for data exchange between organisations. The generic data model is designed in such away that it should be relatively straight forward for other organisations to make a mapping from their own internal data structures to first mile data model. The data model is available in JSON format and in CSV format in GitHub.

2. **Extensions.** The first mile farm data model can be easily be expanded with new data attributes and even new data entities for different purposes. Examples are added for Cocoa action program and MARS Adoption Observations. The data formats are available as together with  protocols how to collect the data in the field. In this way, by adding more and more extensions to the framework, a central repositry emerges of proven data formats and data collection protocols. Organsations can benefit from this repositry harvesting the formats and data collection protocos they need, improving the standardization of first-mile farm data collection in the field. 

3. In addition a approach **to uniquely identify first mile farm data globally** using a system of 3 identifiers is presented and best practice recommendations are given for **spatial data collection**.
